# urlencoded

A parser for `application/x-www-urlencoded` data. This is the default
enctype in HTML forms. Urlencoded can handle Unicode input.

Note that [w3](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp) provides a
useful reference for the urlencoding data format. This website also provides
a tool to see how a form is converted to form data.
